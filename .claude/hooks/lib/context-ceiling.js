// How big an agent's own context has grown, and what to do about it.
//
// Cache reads are the largest single line in this harness's bill — $27.88 of a
// $47.97 run — and they are the integral of resident context over turns, so a
// context that only ever grows is charged for that growth on every remaining
// turn. Measured on the 2026-08-21 sprint-1 baseline, the E1-S1 implementer ran
// 208 turns from 18K to 324K and cost $16.87 by itself. Its conversation held
// about 111K tokens of real content: 76K of tool results, 32K of tool-use
// inputs (33 Write calls carry whole files), 3K of text. Nothing is ever shed,
// so the last hundred turns each re-read a context mostly made of work already
// finished and committed.
//
// The fix is not a smaller context, it is a SHORTER-LIVED one: hand off to a
// fresh implementer that starts from the files on disk plus a handoff note.
// This is the subagent counterpart of the "clear at artifact boundaries"
// doctrine the main loop already follows.

// transcript, a missing usage block, or an unknown agent yields no verdict.
